# periodic-table-database

This project involves the creation of a periodic table database and a script to retrieve information about chemical elements. The database stores data related to elements, including their atomic numbers, symbols, names, properties, and more. The script allows users to query the database and obtain element details based on atomic numbers, symbols, or names.
